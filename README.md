# **1. Business problem**
Rossmann is a european drug store, which have over 3,000 unities in 7 european countries.
Normally the store managers predict their daily sales up to for six weeks in advance, which has two major problems leading to a too much varied accuracy: 1 - Important factors like seasonality, locality and holidays across Europe; 2 - thousands individuals managers doing the predictions based on their own empirical knowledge.
Therefore the goal here is to deliver a more accurate prediction of the sales using a machine learning algorythm.


# **2. Business assumptions**
The assumptions about the business problem are as follows:


# **3. Solution strategy**
Step 01. Data description: My goal is to use statistics metrics to identify data outside the scope of business.
Step 02. Feature engineering: Derive new attributes based on the original variables to better describe the phenomenon that will be modeled.
Step 03. Data filtering: Filter rows and select columns that do not contain information for modeling or that do not match the scope of the business.
Step 04. Exploratory data analysis: Explore the data to find insights and better understand the impact of variables on model learning.
Step 05. Data preparation: Prepare the data so that the Machine Learning models can learn the specific behavior.
Step 06. Feature selection: Selection of the most significant attributes for training the model.
Step 07. Machine learning modelling: Machine Learning model training
Step 08. Hyperparameter fine tunning: Choose the best values for each of the parameters of the model selected from the previous step.
Step 09. Convert model performance to business values: Convert the performance of the Machine Learning model into a business result.
Step 10. Deploy model to production: Publish the model in a cloud environment so that other people or services can use the results to improve the business decision.
